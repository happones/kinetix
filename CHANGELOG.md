## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Custom UI primitives (`Dialog`, `Popover`, `Select`, `ScrollArea`) styled with shadcn v4 tokens.
- Complete subscription and billing management system with Stripe integration, billing manager commands, plans, and customized billing components.
- Advanced Date, Time, and DateTime picker components (`KinetixDatePicker`, `KinetixDateTimePicker`, `KinetixCalendar`).
- Download, Export, Import, and Preview pre-built action wrappers with support for file previewing and background HTTP requests.
- Documentation site (VitePress) under `docs/`, deployed to GitHub Pages via
  `.github/workflows/docs.yml`; reuses the existing feature docs. Run locally with
  `npm run docs:dev`.
- Relation managers can be limited to specific pages via `protected static array
  $visibleOn = ['edit', 'view']` (+ overridable `isVisibleOn($page)`); use
  Resource::relationManagersFor($page) to get the page's managers.
- Laravel Pint integration (`pint.json`, `composer format`).
- `KinetixToaster` (published) — vue-sonner Toaster themed with shadcn tokens so
  toasts read correctly in dark mode.
- Open-source project scaffolding: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`,
  `SECURITY`, this changelog and CI.

### Fixed

- **Bulk export now exports only the selected rows.** `Exporter::resolveExportQuery()`
  auto-scopes the export to the selected `ids` (`whereKey`) — previously a bulk
  `ExportAction` exported the whole table unless you manually scoped `query()` by
  `parameter('ids')`.
- Notification single delete/read failed when `kinetix.teams` was enabled — route
  closures now resolve `{id}` by name rather than positionally.
- Background notification requests now send `Accept: application/json` +
  `credentials: same-origin` so auth/CSRF failures aren't silently followed.
- Component styling (published) aligned to shadcn-vue **new-york-v4**: Switch,
  Checkbox, RadioGroup, Select and the table toggle cell; the focus ring token is
  now `ring-[3px]` everywhere (was the no-op `ring-3`).
- Table pagination now serializes `from` / `to`, so the "Showing X to Y of Z"
  line renders correctly (was `undefined`).
- Type safety: `vue-tsc --noEmit` is now clean; hand-maintained TS types gained
  `KinetixTableData.model`, pagination `from`/`to`, `KinetixTableColumn.isBadge`,
  `KinetixTableRecord.actions`, and a `KinetixConfig` / `KinetixSharedProps` for
  typing `usePage()`.
- Memory safety: the table search debounce is cleared on unmount, and the
  notifications Echo subscription is stopped on unmount.
